> sytnax highlighting extenstion without plugins

## Motivation

Every Solidity extenstion on Visual Studio Code's Marketplacce contain multiple plugins. This can lead
to an inconssistent developer environment, or worse create conflicting configurations that, under the 
pretense of `helping` you, do things in the background to your files wihtout your explicit knowledge. 

Hence why this extenstion exists: only to provide syntax highlighting so that you can decided what to add without
having to give up basic functionality.

## Features

- Solidity Syntax Highlight
- No other plugins, configurations, etc: just syntax highlighting

- Support ^0.5.0 to <0.9.0

- see the additional `.vscode/settings` for better git workspace environment
