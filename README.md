## Motivation

Every Solidity extension on Visual Studio Code's Marketplace contain multiple plugins. This can lead
to an inconsistent developer environment, or worse create conflicting configurations that, under the
pretense of `helping` you, do things in the background to your files without your explicit
knowledge.

Hence why this extension exists: only to provide syntax highlighting so that you can decided what to
add without having to give up basic functionality.
